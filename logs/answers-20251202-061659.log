Q: How do I submit an expense claim?
A: Per the Employee Handbook (Employee_Handbook_Ciklum_PK.pdf), submit an expense claim by creating an “Expense report” in JIRA and attaching original receipts (showing date/time) or proof of payment—scans must be clearly readable. For some reimbursements the Head of CoEs/DMs will create a Navision ticket and Finance will reimburse the amount with the upcoming salary.

Q: Who approves salary increases?
A: Final approval of salary increases is done by the Executive Team. The Total Rewards team develops the approach and managers submit individual proposals based on provided guidelines and budgets (Employee_Handbook_Ciklum_PK.pdf).

Q: Who founded Ciklum?
A: Ciklum was founded in 2002 by Danish native Torben Majgaard (sources: Wikipedia; torbenmajgaard.com; Kyiv Post).
